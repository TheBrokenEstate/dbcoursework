This is the code for my Computer Science coursework project. Please read the "Setup and Installation" section to get started.

## Code for Coursework
This is the code I am submitting to be marked for my Computer Science coursework. There may be bugs in the system, hopefully not too many, I will continue to squash them after the code is marked.

## Setup and Installation
### For Testing and Assessment
1. Ensure python 3.8 or greater is installed.
2. Open CMD on Windows, or a terminal on Linux.
3. Navigate to the project's directory. (By default this document is contained in it.)
4. If you wish to use a virtual enviroment run `python -m venv ./venv` and then `./venv/Scripts/activate.bat` on Windows, or `./venv/Scripts/activate` on Linux.
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements for this program.
6. Run `python setup-database.py` to initialize the database.
7. Run `python run.py` to run the server.
8. Open a browser and navagate to `localhost:5000`.

### For Hosting and Deployment
We are now hosted on [Redacted until after code assessment].
